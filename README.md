# GPS-Position-Prediction-and-correction-using-Kalman-Filter
Various uncontrollable and unpredictable factors ( e.g., atmospheric disturbances, failure of the GPS antenna, electromagnetic interference, weather change, GPS signal attack, or solar activity) may cause GPS receivers to lose signal occasionally, even if their antennas are placed in a location with an unobstructed view of the satellites. Kalman Filter is an iterative mathematical process that quickly estimates one’s true position by using a set of equations and consecutive data inputs. In order to reduce errors made by a GPS in prediction of a vehicle’s position, linear Kalman Filter and non-linear Kalman Filter algorithms are used. In addition to this, u-Blox Neo6M GPS module is used to measure the vehicle’s position. Data from a triaxial accelerometer - ADXL345, triaxial magnetometer - QMC5833L and triaxial gyroscope - MPU6050 are used. With this data we were able to measure the heading of the object and make more accurate predictions.. Kalman FIlter is a three stage process and it provides low cost and accurate estimation of the object's position. The model was tested in real time on Raspberry Pi 3 and the predicted results were plotted on Google Maps.
